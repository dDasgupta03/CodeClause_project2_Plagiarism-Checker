Word embedding in NLP is an important term, used for representing words for text analysis in the form of real-valued vectors. It is an advancement in NLP that has improved the ability of computers to understand text-based content in a better way and is considered one of the most significant breakthroughs of deep learning for solving NLP problems.

In this approach, words and documents are represented in the form of numeric vectors which represent different words with different vectors. The extracted features are fed into a machine learning model for working with text data preserving the semantic and syntactic information. This information once received in its converted form is used by NLP algorithms that easily digest these learned representations and process textual information.
