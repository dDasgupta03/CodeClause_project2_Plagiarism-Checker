Word embedding in NLP is an important term that is used for representing words for text analysis in the form of real-valued vectors. It is considered one of the most significant breakthroughs of deep learning for solving challenging natural language processing problems. It is an advancement in NLP that has improved the ability of computers to understand text-based content in a better way. 

In this approach, words and documents are represented in the form of numeric vectors that allow similar words to have similar vector representations. The extracted features are fed into a machine learning model so as to work with text data and preserve the semantic and syntactic information. This information once received in its converted form is used by NLP algorithms that easily digest these learned representations and process textual information.
